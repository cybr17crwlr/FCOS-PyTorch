    Generalized Intersection over Union Loss (Hamid Rezatofighi et. al)
    https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09630
    Gradient-friendly IoU loss with an additional penalty that is non-zero when the
    boxes do not overlap and scales with the size of their smallest enclosing box.
    This loss is symmetric, so the boxes1 and boxes2 arguments are interchangeable.
    Args:
        boxes1, boxes2 (Tensor): box locations in XYXY format, shape (N, 4) or (4,).
        reduction: 'none' | 'mean' | 'sum'
                 'none': No reduction will be applied to the output.
                 'mean': The output will be averaged.
                 'sum': The output will be summed.
